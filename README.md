# unified-ui

> **Unified-UI for your AI** — One interface for all your AI agents, regardless of origin.

## Overview

**unifiedui** is a unified integration platform that transforms the complexity of managing multiple AI systems into a single, cohesive experience. Organizations today deploy agents across diverse platforms—Microsoft Foundry, n8n, LangGraph, Copilot, and custom solutions—resulting in fragmented user experiences, inconsistent monitoring, and operational silos. unifiedui eliminates these challenges by providing a unified interface where every agent converges into one platform.

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Unified Chat Interface** — Single, consistent chat experience for all AI agents
- 🔌 **Multi-Platform Integration** — Microsoft Foundry, n8n, LangGraph, Copilot, and custom agents
- 🎨 **Flexible Widget System** — Custom UI components embedded into conversations
- 📊 **Centralized Tracing** — Unified observability across all agents
- 🔐 **Enterprise Authentication** — Microsoft Entra ID, Google OAuth, and more
- 🌍 **Cloud-Agnostic** — Deploy on Azure, AWS, GCP, or on-premises
- 🚀 **Autonomous Agent Support** — Background agents with centralized tracing

## The Problem unifiedui Solves

### Fragmented AI Experiences
- **Inconsistent interfaces**: Each platform has its own chat experience
- **Missing UI layers**: Custom agents (e.g., LangGraph) often lack user interfaces
- **Scattered monitoring**: Tracing data lives in disparate systems

### Integration Complexity
- Custom API integrations for each agent system
- Bespoke authentication and authorization flows
- Redundant implementations of common features

### Rapid Technology Obsolescence
- Agent frameworks evolve quickly; today's tools may be tomorrow's legacy
- **unifiedui decouples agent frameworks from user experience**
- Integrate legacy and modern systems simultaneously
- Seamless transitions without disrupting end users
